# Configure Zabbix HA

In this section, we will set up Zabbix in a High Availability (HA) configuration.
This feature, introduced in Zabbix 6, is a crucial enhancement that ensures continued
monitoring even if a Zabbix server fails. With HA, when one Zabbix server goes down,
another can take over seamlessly.

For this guide, we will use two Zabbix servers, but the setup allows for adding more
if necessary.

It's important to note that Zabbix's HA setup is straightforward,
providing redundancy without complex features like load balancing.

Just as in our basic configuration, we will document key details for the servers
in this HA setup. Below is the list of servers and their respective IP addresses:

![HA Setup](image/ha/HA-setup.png){width=80%}

| Server          | IP Address    |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Zabbix Server 1 | 192.168.0.130 |
| Zabbix Server 2 | 192.168.0.131 |
| PostgreSQL DB   | 192.168.0.132 |
| Virtual IP      | 192.168.0.135 |

???+ note
    Our database (DB) in this setup is not configured for HA. Since it's not a
    Zabbix component, you will need to implement your own solution for database HA,
    such as a HA SAN or a database cluster setup. A DB cluster configuration is out
    of the scope of this guide and unrelated to Zabbix, so it will not be covered here.

---

## Installing PostgreSQL Database

To set up the Zabbix HA environment, we'll begin by installing the PostgreSQL database.
Follow these steps to install PostgreSQL on a Red Hat-based system.

???+ note
    If you're using a non-x86 architecture or another OS, refer to the
    [PostgreSQL official download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for the
    correct installation commands.

???+ warning
    In this exercise, we will simplify the PostgreSQL and OS installation.
    For detailed configurations and optimizations, review the previous sections
    of this guide.

1. **Install the PostgreSQL repository:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-9-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
   ```

2. **Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf -qy module disable postgresql
   ```

3. **Install PostgreSQL 16:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y postgresql16-server
   ```

4. **Initialize the database and enable automatic startup:**

   ```bash
   sudo /usr/pgsql-16/bin/postgresql-16-setup initdb
   sudo systemctl enable postgresql-16 --now
   ```

At this stage, PostgreSQL should be installed and running, ready for configuration
with Zabbix in an HA setup.

---

### Securing the PostgreSQL Database

PostgreSQL manages access permissions differently compared to MySQL or MariaDB.
Specifically, PostgreSQL uses the `pg_hba.conf` file, which controls who can access
the database, from where, and what encryption is used for passwords.
To allow the Zabbix frontend and Zabbix server to connect to the PostgreSQL database,
we need to configure this file accordingly.

First, edit the `pg_hba.conf` file to specify the access permissions:

```bash
# vi /var/lib/pgsql/16/data/pg_hba.conf
```

Update the file to include the following lines:

```bash
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     trust
# IPv4 local connections:
host    zabbix          zabbix  192.168.0.130/32               scram-sha-256
host    zabbix          zabbix  192.168.0.131/32               scram-sha-256
host    all             all     127.0.0.1/32                   scram-sha-256
```

This configuration permits the Zabbix servers (at IPs `192.168.0.130` and
`192.168.0.131`) to connect using SCRAM-SHA-256 encryption.

Once youâ€™ve updated `pg_hba.conf`, don't forget to restart PostgreSQL for the
changes to take effect. But before doing so, you also need to modify `postgresql.conf`
to allow incoming connections from the Zabbix servers.

---

By default, PostgreSQL listens only on the Unix socket, restricting external connections.
To change this, edit the `postgresql.conf` file:

```bash
# vi /var/lib/pgsql/16/data/postgresql.conf
```

Find and modify the `listen_addresses` line to:

```plaintext
listen_addresses = '*'
```

This will allow PostgreSQL to listen on all network interfaces, enabling external
connections from the Zabbix servers.


After making the changes to both configuration files, restart the PostgreSQL service:

```bash
# systemctl restart postgresql-16
```

If PostgreSQL fails to restart, check the `pg_hba.conf` file for any syntax errors
or typos.

---

#### Add the Zabbix repository and populate the DB

To set up the Zabbix database, you need to add the appropriate Zabbix repository
and install the necessary database scripts. Begin by adding the Zabbix repository.
Ensure that you select the correct repository for your operating system and Zabbix
version by visiting [Zabbix download page](https://www.zabbix.com/download).

For example, on a RHEL-based system:

```bash
# rpm -Uvh https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/7.0/rhel/9/x86_64/zabbix-release-latest.el9.noarch.rpm
```

### Install the database scripts

Once the repository is added, install the database scripts:

```bash
# dnf install zabbix-sql-scripts -y
```

Next, unzip the database schema files required to create the necessary tables:

```bash
# gzip -d /usr/share/zabbix-sql-scripts/postgresql/server.sql.gz
```

At this point, the PostgreSQL database is secured, and the Zabbix database schema
is ready to be populated.

---

### Creating the Database Users

With PostgreSQL configured and ready, the next step is to create the Zabbix users.
These users will be used by both the Zabbix server and frontend to interact with
the database.
If you prefer to separate the users for the frontend and the server, refer to the
basic installation guide for additional details.

To create a new user for the Zabbix server:

- Switch to the `postgres` user:

```bash
# su - postgres
```

- Use the `createuser` command to create the Zabbix user and assign a password:

```bash
# createuser --pwprompt zabbix
```

You will be prompted to enter a password for the new role:

```plaintext
    Enter password for new role: <server-password>
    Enter it again: <server-password>

    Replace `<server-password>` with a strong, secure password that you will use
    for the Zabbix server's database connection.
```

Once the user is created, this account will be ready to use by both the
`Zabbix server` and frontend (unless you choose to create separate users for each).

---

#### Populating the Database

With the Zabbix user created, we can now set up the Zabbix database.
Follow these steps to create and populate the database with the necessary schemas
and data.

1. **Create the Zabbix Database**

Switch to the `postgres` user and create the Zabbix database:

```bash
    # su - postgres
    # createdb -E Unicode -O zabbix zabbix
```

This command creates a new database named `zabbix`, using Unicode encoding
and assigning ownership to the `zabbix` user.

- **Populate the Database**

Next, connect to the database as the `zabbix` user and run the SQL script to
set up the required schemas, tables, and data. Use the `psql`
command-line tool:

```bash
    # psql -U zabbix -W zabbix
    Password:
    psql (16.2)
    Type "help" for help.

    zabbix=> SELECT session_user, current_user;
    session_user | current_user
    --------------+--------------
    zabbix       | zabbix
    (1 row)
```

   Once connected, execute the SQL script:

```sql
    zabbix=> \i /usr/share/zabbix-sql-scripts/postgresql/server.sql
```

You should see output indicating that tables are being created and data is being inserted:

```plaintext
    CREATE TABLE
    CREATE INDEX
    CREATE TABLE
    ...
    INSERT 0 1
    DELETE 80424
    COMMIT
```

- **Verify Table Ownership**

Ensure that the `zabbix` user owns the tables by listing them:

```sql
zabbix=> \dt
               List of relations
Schema |            Name            | Type  | Owner
--------+----------------------------+-------+--------
public | acknowledges               | table | zabbix
public | actions                    | table | zabbix
...
```

If the tables are correctly owned by the `zabbix` user, you can exit
the `psql` prompt:

```sql
    zabbix=> \q
```

The database is now populated and ready for use by the Zabbix server.

### Configuring the Firewall

To complete the setup, you need to configure the firewall to allow incoming connections
to the PostgreSQL database from the Zabbix server. By default, the firewall does
not permit these connections, so we'll need to open the appropriate ports and
define rules.

- **Create a New Firewall Zone**

   Create a new firewall zone specifically for PostgreSQL access:

```bash
# firewall-cmd --new-zone=postgresql-access --permanent
success
```

- **Reload the Firewall Configuration**

   Apply the changes by reloading the firewall configuration:

```bash
    # firewall-cmd --reload
    success
```

- **Verify Available Zones**

  Confirm that the new zone has been added:

```bash
    # firewall-cmd --get-zones
    block dmz drop external home internal nm-shared postgresql-access public
    trusted work
```

- **Add the Zabbix Server IPs to the New Zone**

    Allow the Zabbix server IP addresses to access the PostgreSQL database.
    Replace `<zabbix-serverip 1>` and `<zabbix-serverip 2>` with the actual IP
    addresses of your Zabbix servers:

```bash
    # firewall-cmd --zone=postgresql-access --add-source=<zabbix-serverip 1> --permanent
    success

    # firewall-cmd --zone=postgresql-access --add-source=<zabbix-serverip 2> --permanent
    success
```

- **Allow PostgreSQL Port**

   Open port 5432 for TCP connections in the new zone:

```bash
    # firewall-cmd --zone=postgresql-access --add-port=5432/tcp --permanent
    success
```

- **Reload the Firewall Configuration Again**

   Reload the firewall to apply the new rules:

```bash
    # firewall-cmd --reload
```

- **Verify the Firewall Rules**

   Check that the firewall rules are correctly set up:

```bash
    # firewall-cmd --zone=postgresql-access --list-all
```

Your PostgreSQL server is now configured to accept connections from your Zabbix
server. You can proceed with the next task in your Zabbix HA setup.

---

## Installing the Zabbix Cluster

Setting up a Zabbix cluster involves configuring multiple Zabbix servers to work
together, providing high availability. While the process is similar to setting up
a single Zabbix server, there are additional configuration steps required to
enable HA (High Availability).

### Adding Zabbix Repositories

First, add the Zabbix 7.0 repositories to both of your Zabbix servers:

```bash
# rpm -Uvh https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/7.0/rhel/9/x86_64/zabbix-release-6.5-2.el9.noarch.rpm
```

### Installing Zabbix Servers

Once the repository is added, install the Zabbix server package on both servers:

```bash
# dnf install zabbix-server-pgsql -y
```

### Configuring Zabbix Server 1

Edit the Zabbix server configuration file on the first server:

```bash
# vi /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf
```

Update the following lines to connect to the PostgreSQL database:

```plaintext
DBHost=<zabbix db ip>
DBName=zabbix
DBUser=zabbix
DBPassword=<your secret password>
```

Configure the HA parameters for this server:

```plaintext
HANodeName=zabbix1 (or choose a name you prefer)
```

Specify the frontend node address for failover scenarios:

```plaintext
NodeAddress=<Zabbix server 1 ip>:10051
```

### Configuring Zabbix Server 2

Repeat the configuration steps for the second Zabbix server. Adjust the `HANodeName`
and `NodeAddress` as necessary for this server.

### Starting Zabbix Server

After configuring both servers, enable and start the `zabbix-server` service on each:

```bash
# systemctl enable zabbix-server --now
```

### Verifying the Configuration

Check the log files on both servers to ensure they have started correctly and are
operating in their respective HA modes.

On the first server:

```bash
# grep HA /var/log/zabbix/zabbix_server.log
```

You should see:

```plaintext
22597:20240309:155230.353 starting HA manager
22597:20240309:155230.362 HA manager started in active mode
```

On the second server (and any additional nodes):

```bash
# grep HA /var/log/zabbix/zabbix_server.log
```

You should see:

```plaintext
22304:20240309:155331.163 starting HA manager
22304:20240309:155331.174 HA manager started in standby mode
```

Your Zabbix cluster should now be set up with high availability, ensuring continuous
monitoring even if one of the servers fails.

---

## Installing the frontends

First things first before we can install and configure our webserver we need to
install keepalived. Keepalived allows us to use a VIP for our frontends. Keepalived
provides frameworks for both load balancing and high availability.

???+ info
    Some useful documentation on the subject you might like.
    <https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/advanced-keepalived> and <https://keepalived.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>

### Setup keepalived

So let's get started.
On both our servers we have to install keepalived.

```bash
dnf install keepalived
```

We also need to adapt the configuration of keepalived on both servers.
The configuration for both servers needs to be a bit changed so let's start with
our server 1. Edit the config file with the following command:

```bash
# vi /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
```

Delete everything and replace it with the following lines:

```bash
vrrp_track_process track_nginx {
    process nginx
    weight 10
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface enp0s1
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 244
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 12345
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.0.135
    }
    track_process {
         track_nginx
      }
}
```

Replace `enp0s1` with the interface name of your machine and replace the password
with something secure. For the virual_ipaddress use aa free IP from your network.
Now do the same thing for our second Zabbix server.

```bash
# vi /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
```

Delete everything and replace it with the following lines:

```bash
vrrp_track_process track_nginx {
      process nginx
      weight 10
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    interface enp0s1
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 243
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 12345
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.0.135
    }
    track_process {
         track_nginx
      }
}
```

Just as with our 1st Zabbix server, replace `enp0s1` with the interface name of
your machine and replace the password with something secure. For the virual_ipaddress
use aa free IP from your network.

### Install and configure the frontend

On both servers we can run the following commands to install our webserver and the
zabbix frontend packages:

```bash
dnf install nginx zabbix-web-pgsql zabbix-nginx-conf
```

Also let's not forget to configure our firewall

```bash
firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-service=zabbix-server --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

And now we can start our keepalived and enable it so that it comes up next reboot

```bash
systemctl enable keepalived nginx --now
```

### Configure Zabbix Frontend

![Zabbix Server Setup](image/ha/welcome.png){width=80%}

After configuring the Zabbix servers, you need to complete the setup via the
Zabbix web interface. Follow these steps:

- **Access the Zabbix Web Interface**

   Navigate through the web interface until you reach the page where you need to
   configure the database connection.

- **Fill in Database Connection Details**

   - **Database IP Address:** Enter the IP address of your PostgreSQL database server.
   - **Port:** You can leave this as `0` to use the default port (5432).
   - **Database Name:** Enter the name of your database (e.g., `zabbix`).
   - **User:** Enter the database user (e.g., `zabbix`).
   - **Password:** Enter the password for the database user.

   **Note:** Ensure you deselect TLS encryption and select the option to store
   passwords as plaintext.

- **Adjust SELinux Settings**

   If you encounter issues during the configuration due to SELinux restrictions,
   run the following commands on both Zabbix servers to allow the web server to
   communicate with the database:

```bash
    # setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db on
    # setsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix on
```

   These commands modify SELinux policies to enable network connections between
   the web server and the database.

- **Continue with the Setup**

   After adjusting SELinux settings, return to the web interface and click "Next."
   The setup should proceed without issues.

By completing these steps, your Zabbix servers should be fully configured and
connected to the database, ready for use in your monitoring environment.


![DB Setup](image/ha/db-connection.png){width=80%}

We are almost ready the only thing left here is now to add the name of our server
and configure the default timezone.

![DB Setup](image/ha/settings.png){width=80%}

Since youâ€™re using a host-based firewall, you need to add the necessary rules to
permit IP protocol 112 traffic. Otherwise, Keepalivedâ€™s advertisement method wonâ€™t work.

```
firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule protocol value="112" accept' --permanent
```

Now that this is all taken care of stop keepalived on our server and repeat the
same steps on the second server. After this is finished start keepalived again.

Congratulations you have a HA Zabbix server now .

#### Checking the Database for HA Information

Once your Zabbix HA setup is operational, you might want to verify the status
of your servers within the database. Hereâ€™s how to check the information:

- **Query HA Node Information**

Access your Zabbix database and run the following SQL query to view details about the HA nodes:

```sql
    zabbix=# SELECT * FROM ha_node;
```

```sql
Example output:

         ha_nodeid         |  name   |    address    | port  | lastaccess | status |       ha_sessionid
---------------------------+---------+---------------+-------+------------+--------+---------------------------
 cltk7h2n600017kkd1jtx6f1f | zabbix2 | 192.168.0.131 | 10051 | 1710085786 |      0 | cltlov4ly0000jkkdteikeo77
 cltk7ci340001inkc2befwg9f | zabbix1 | 192.168.0.130 | 10051 | 1710085787 |      3 | cltlov1r00000jtkcpeh9oqhp
```

This query provides information on each HA node, including its ID, name, address, port, last access time, status, and session ID.

- **Understanding Node Statuses**

The status column in the `ha_node` table indicates the current state of each node. Here are the possible statuses:

   | Status      | Number | Description                                             |
   | :---------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Active      | 3      | Only one node can be active at any time                |
   | Standby     | 0      | Multiple nodes can be in standby mode                  |
   | Stopped     | 1      | A node has been detected as stopped                    |
   | Unavailable | 2      | A node was lost without proper shutdown detection       |

The frontend uses this information to determine which server to connect to based
on the active and standby nodes.

- **Configuring Zabbix Agents**

Ensure that Zabbix agents are configured to point to both the active and passive Zabbix servers. This option is supported in all agents since Zabbix 6.0.

```plaintext
Server=<active-server-ip>,<passive-server-ip>
ServerActive=<active-server-ip>,<passive-server-ip>
```

This configuration ensures that agents can communicate with both servers,
enhancing redundancy and reliability.
